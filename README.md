==============

This is a project that was designed to give me some experience in a larger scale program built from the ground up.

I followed a video tutorial but modified some parts to suit me better, and made sure I understood everything that was being done. 

It is not the most efficient way to create a chess engine but as it was only intended as a learning tool it was fine for my needs.
